## Stuff I Wrote
Welcome to the Beta 0.9.0 of the ExcelManager. The final goal of the code is to convert a MSB Shipping Report and convert it to an Easyprint one using a .exe file. So far, I've learned to read, write. I've completed some algorithms to copy all the information on but lack some key information regarding the easyprint format. The algorithm in place could be inefficient, so looking to find a new solution. I also got a basic GUI working, but looking to make it prettier and then its time to release it.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
